# Asteroids
A fun little game in which you control a spaceship and need to avoid getting hit by asteroids.
You are able to move and shoot at asteroids, causing them to split into smaller ones, eventually disappearing completely
Have Fun!

## Controls
You can move forward and back with the W and S keys respectively.
The A key rotates your character counterclockwise, D rotates clockwise.
The spacebar spawns a projectile at your current position and which travels straight into the direction you were looking when providing the input.
If your character collides with an asteroid the game will end.

## Requirements
Requires python 3.10 and pygame 2.6.0
